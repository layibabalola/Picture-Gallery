    <h3>The Babalola Picture Gallery</h3>
    <p>This site will make it easier to share pictures (and in the future, videos?) that we take at family events.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, cloud space isnt yet unlimited, so we'll instead be using traditional, unlimited web hosting in conjunction with this site.</p>
    <p>Have pictures to share? Ask me for an ftp login, and i'll show you how to upload them.</p>
    <p>Once uploaded, this site will automatically create a Picture Gallery for your set of uploaded images!</p>
    <p>And yes, everyone will be able to download them all at once instead of one by one!</p>
